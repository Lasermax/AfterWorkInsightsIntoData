**AfterWorkInsightsIntoData**

Welcome to my *AfterWorkInsightsIntoData* repository! 

Here, I present the results of some data analytics projects that I work on in my spare time. Each project explores interesting datasets, provides analyses, and showcases insightful visualizations. Depending on the project, I use Python or R for my analyses.
As I work on these projects in my spare time, it may take a while to publish the analyses after downloading and exploring the data.

While I use Python and R for my analyses, the reports are provided as PDF files for easy viewing.
